ðŸ“Š Employee Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel! ðŸ’¼

I just practiced this project using a simple basic employee dataset to improve my Excel data analysis skills.

In this project, I applied:
âœ… Excel formulas to calculate and compare employee details
âœ… PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize key metrics
âœ… Slicers to make the dashboard interactive and easy to use

This hands-on practice helped me strengthen my data analysis and visualization skills while learning how to organize and present HR-related data effectively.

ðŸ’¡ Next Step: I plan to recreate this project in Power BI for more advanced visualization and insights!
